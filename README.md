# capture-the-ether-challs
Solving the Capture the Ether challenges, my second stop on my smart contracts learning journey.

## Previously...

I started smart contracts CTF challenges with the Ethernaut [website](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/). My (not very explicit) solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/Krow10/ethernaut-challs).

## Why ?

Basically I wanted to try to apply what I learned from the previous challenges to *speedrun* this one and prove to myself that I know some things about smart contracts vulnerability. 

I think I did okay, solving most of them in less than a week (though I couldn't work full-time on them like I did in the previous ones). Some presented a certain difficulty however and pretty interesting to solve.

## What ?

As the previous challenges, my solutions are listed here with each directory containing either a `.sol` smart contract along with its deployement script for the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) or a `.js` file to be run within a web3-enabled console.

I plan to start using [hardhat](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat) or similar for the next ones to be familiar with a local blockchain setup.

## Next ?

Currently finishing the last challenge [Token Bank](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/miscellaneous/token-bank/), I plan to leave some of them aside as they require either [bruteforce](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/lotteries/predict-the-future/) or some [better setup](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/math/fifty-years/) than what I use currently (running JS from the Ethernaut website through the web console).

Also I'm aiming at the [Damn Vulnerable DeFi](https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/) challs next (which requires a hardhat setup, win-win !).
